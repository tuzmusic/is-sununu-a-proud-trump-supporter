    <p>Like Donald Trump, Chris Sununu Said The Affordable Care Act “Is A Disaster, It Has Failed, And [It] Must Be
        Repealed.” <a href="https://soundcloud.com/girardatlarge/09-09-2016-1b?in=girardatlarge/sets/09-09-2016">[Girard

            Large, 6:30, 9/9/16]</a></p>

    <p>Like Donald Trump, Sununu is Anti-Choice, Nominated An Anti-Choice Activist To Lead the State's Highest Court And
        Pledged To Renominate His Anti-Choice Pick If Re-Elected.

            [WMUR, 9/24/20]</a></p>

    <p>Chris Sununu Even Stood By Trump Even Though Trump Refused To Condemn White Supremacists. According to WMUR,
        “Sununu
        was then asked by Sexton if he still supports Trump’s reelection, and the governor responded, ‘Yes.’”

            10/1/20]</a>
    </p>

    <p>Chris Sununu Also Stood By Trump After He Bragged About Sexually Assaulting Women. According to WMUR, Sununu
        “continued to support then-candidate Donald Trump after Trump’s controversial comments on the ‘Access Hollywood’
        tape and after 13 women accused Trump of sexual harassment.”
